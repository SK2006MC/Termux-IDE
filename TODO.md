## Technical Notes

1. All file operations must be performed through TermuxBridgeService
2. Use sharedUserId for Termux integration
3. Implement proper error handling throughout
4. Focus on asynchronous operations to maintain UI responsiveness
5. Prioritize security in file system operations

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Core services
- [ ] File operations
- [ ] Terminal commands
- [ ] Editor functionality

### Integration Tests
- [ ] UI components
- [ ] Service interactions
- [ ] Termux integration
- [ ] Error scenarios

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Large file operations
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous operations
- [ ] Memory usage
- [ ] UI responsiveness

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 - Core Architecture Setup
2. Focus on getting basic functionality working
3. Implement error handling early
4. Keep UI responsive through async operations
5. Test thoroughly at each phase

This plan is flexible and can be adjusted based on progress and requirements.
